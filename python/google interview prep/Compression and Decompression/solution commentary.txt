A basic solution involves use of simple recursion and loops.

Alternatively you can try a â€œpeel the onion" approach, where you first decode top layer without using recursion, and then if there is any repetition group left, do the same with output after first phase. This is not bad, but the first approach is better as it may use a lot less memory.

There are several catches, for example:

numbers with multiple digits, like 10 or 100
handling non-repeated strings
handling repetitions inside
not doing the same job twice
not copying too much
Discussion questions
Once you've tried the problem, try thinking through these questions -- and maybe even write more code to push your skills a step further.

1. How would you test your solution in light of you've practiced in this path?

2. What are some different approaches you could take to your solution -- and how would you test those?
