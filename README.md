# extracurricular
I felt incredibly blindsided by my first coding interview. I thought this should not be the case at all, I go to a good school, and I study computer engineering, how do I not know how to answer these questions if I've taken data structures and algorithms and received an A? So I decided to do what I later learned most people do and practice in an extracurricular fashion for these kinds of interviews and future job problems. I wish I would've learned to do this sooner, but such is life. I'm still not fully convinced that I want to go into software, but since there are a lot of jobs in the field and I don't mind coding, I'm going to study up.
