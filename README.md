# extracurricular
I felt incredibly blindsided by my first coding interview. I thought this should not be the case at all, I go to a good school, and I study computer engineering, how do I not know how to answer these questions if I've taken data structures and algorithms and received an A? So I decided to do what I later learned most people do and practice in an extracurricular fashion for these kinds of interviews and future job problems. I wish I would've learned to do this sooner, but such is life.
